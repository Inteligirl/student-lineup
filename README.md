# C++ Class Project Student Line-up

This programming challenge as outline in class.


## Project specifications:

A teacher has asked all her students to line up single file according to their first name.  
For example, in one class Amy will be in front of the line and Yolanda will be at the end.
Write a program that will read in a file of names.  
Names should be read until there are no more names to be read.    
Use LineUp.txt as a test file for your program.
Once all the names have been read in display which student will be at the front of the line and which one would be at the end of the line.  You may assume that no two students have the same name.

## My step process
+C++ Use a supplied input file
+Store intial data to begin comparison
+Compare each value in file to current saved variable
+If conditions are met update value of variable
+Display final values of the stored variables firstStudent and lastStudent
